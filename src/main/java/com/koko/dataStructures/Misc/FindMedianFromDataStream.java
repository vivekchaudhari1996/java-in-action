    //Q:
    /*
    The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list.
    If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far.

    // Example:
    /*
    Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

// Q Variant:
    /*
    Supposing that you have a stream of integer,
    implement the following two methods to return the median value (value of the middle. It's not the mean).
    The median value does not need to be exact. It can be within a range of 2^n-1 to 2^n+1.
For example:
addValue(1)
addValue(6)
addValue(10)
getMedian() can return any value between 4 to 7.

    // Idea1:


    // Bucket 1 : [1,2)
    //Bucket 2 : [2,4)
    //Bucket 3: [4,8)
    //Bucket 4: [8,16)
    //Bucket 5: [16, 32)
    //Bucket 6: [32, 64)
    //So on.
    //Given a incoming stream of numbers we have to return any number in the bucket, in which the median lies in
    //Ex: 1,6,10
    //Median is 6, it lies in bucket 3, you can return any number from 4 to 7.
    //The observation here is, all numbers with same MSB(most significant bit) lie in the same bucket,
    // so here we care only about MSB of incoming numbers.
    //Assuming the integers fit in 64 bit, we can create an array of size 64, every time integer comes,
    // we can increment the count of that bucket.
    // Now we just need to find the median in elements of array cnt,
    // only including numbers with MSB as i and cnt[i] > 0.



    // Idea 2:
    // Ex: 1,6,10
    //Median is 6, it lies in bucket 3, you can return any number from 4 to 7.
    //The observation here is, all numbers with same MSB(most significant bit) lie in the same bucket,
    // so here we care only about MSB of incoming numbers.
    //Assuming the integers fit in 64 bit, we can create an array of size 64,
    // every time integer comes, we can increment the count of that bucket.
    // Now we just need to find the median in elements of array cnt,
    // only including numbers with MSB as i and cnt[i] > 0.

    // We can use a variable to track number of elements that are added till now.
    // Then we can traverse buckets array from 0 index to 63 till the time Î£ buckets (from 0...i)
    // is less than elements/2. Then our answer would be 2^(i+1)
